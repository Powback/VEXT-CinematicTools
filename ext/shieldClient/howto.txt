Okay, first we need to include the lua file you created.
	ve_XP3test = require "XP3Test"
	
The name is the class of the LUA file.
So XP3Test is XP3Test, not ve_XP3test
You can call it whatever you want, but the "require" must match the name of the LUA file and class

Then we need to load the preset
	self.m_xp3test = json.decode(ve_XP3test:GetPreset())

Then we need to select a button where we load the preset.
	if InputManager:WentKeyDown(InputDeviceKeys.IDK_F4) then
		-- WebUI:ExecuteJS('document.location.reload()')
		self:LoadPreset(self.m_xp3test)
	end
	
	
So now, when you are ingame, press f4 to load the preset you saved.

I want to add this to the ingame UI in the future, but I haven't found a good way to do it.
